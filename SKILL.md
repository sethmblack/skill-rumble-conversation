# Rumble Conversation

Structure and facilitate a difficult conversation using Brene Brown's rumbling methodology - leaning into vulnerability, staying curious and generous, owning your part, and achieving clarity without blame or shame.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Help someone weaponize vulnerability for manipulation
- Provide scripts designed to shame, blame, or attack identity
- Frame the conversation as winning/losing rather than understanding
- Help avoid accountability by focusing only on the other person's behavior
- Skip the self-examination steps (checking your SFD, owning your part)

**If asked to help attack or manipulate:** Refuse explicitly. Rumbling is about connection, not conquest.

---

## When to Use

- You need to give difficult feedback to a colleague or team member
- There's unresolved tension or conflict in a relationship
- You need to address a pattern that isn't working
- A decision needs honest dialogue, not defensive debate
- Someone says "We need to rumble on this"
- User asks "How do I have this hard conversation?" or "How do I give feedback without shaming?"
- After a failure or incident when emotions are running high

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| situation | Yes | The issue or tension that needs to be addressed |
| relationship | Yes | Who you're talking to and your history |
| sfd | No | The story you're making up (your assumptions) |
| your_part | No | What you might have contributed to the situation |
| outcome | No | What you hope to achieve through the conversation |

---

## Core Philosophy

From Brene Brown's research:

**"Clear is kind. Unclear is unkind."**

The greatest barrier to courageous leadership is avoiding tough conversations. When we speak "around" the issue, hint at problems, or protect people from honest feedback, we're actually protecting OURSELVES from discomfort - and it's unkind to everyone involved.

**A rumble is a discussion defined by:**
- Commitment to lean into vulnerability
- Staying curious and generous
- Sticking with the messy middle of problem identification
- Taking breaks and circling back when necessary
- Being fearless in owning our parts
- Listening with the same passion with which we want to be heard

## The Rumble Framework

### Pre-Rumble: Check Yourself

Before the conversation, you MUST complete these steps:

**1. Name Your SFD (Sh***y First Draft)**

The SFD is the story you're making up based on incomplete information. Your brain fills in gaps with worst-case narratives. Name it explicitly:

> "The story I'm making up is that [person] doesn't respect my work / thinks I'm incompetent / doesn't care about the project / is trying to undermine me."

This isn't necessarily true - it's the narrative your fear is generating.

**2. Own Your Part**

What might you have contributed to this situation? Be honest:
- Did you fail to communicate expectations clearly?
- Did you avoid an earlier conversation that needed to happen?
- Did you make assumptions without checking them?
- Did you model the behavior you're now criticizing?

**3. Check Your Intention**

Ask yourself: "Am I going into this to understand, or to be right?"

If the answer is "to be right," you're not ready to rumble. A rumble is about connection and clarity, not winning.

---

### The Rumble: Six Elements

**1. Name the Specific Issue**

Not vague complaints. Specific, observable behavior or situation.

| Instead of | Say |
|------------|-----|
| "You're not engaged" | "In the last three meetings, you've been on your phone during discussions" |
| "This isn't working" | "The deployment process has failed three times this month" |
| "I don't feel supported" | "When I asked for help with the presentation, I didn't hear back" |

**2. Explain the Impact**

How does this affect you, the team, the work? Make it concrete.

> "When [specific behavior], I feel [emotion] because [impact]."

Example: "When I don't hear back about my questions, I feel uncertain because I can't move forward with confidence."

**3. Own Your Part**

Share what you contributed. This isn't weakness - it's modeling vulnerability.

> "I want to own that I [your contribution]. That's on me."

Example: "I want to own that I didn't flag this earlier. I was avoiding the discomfort."

**4. Stay Curious**

Use Brene's rumble language:
- "Say more about that."
- "Help me understand."
- "Tell me what you mean by..."
- "Walk me through your thinking."
- "What am I missing?"

**5. Invite Dialogue**

Make space for their perspective:
- "What's your take on this?"
- "What am I not seeing?"
- "What do you need from me?"
- "Is there something I'm doing that makes this harder?"

**6. Agree on Action**

End with clear next steps:
- What will each person do differently?
- When will you check in?
- What does success look like?

---

### Post-Rumble: Reflect

After the conversation:
- Did you stay curious or get defensive?
- Did you listen as much as you spoke?
- Did you learn something about your SFD?
- What do you need to do next?

---

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Rumble Preparation: [Situation]

### Pre-Rumble Self-Examination

**My SFD (The story I'm making up):**
[Your fear-based narrative about what's happening]

**Reality check:** Is this story definitely true, or is it my fear talking?

**My Part:**
[What you contributed to this situation - be honest]

**My Intention Check:**
Am I entering this to understand, or to be right?
[Your honest assessment]

---

### The Rumble Structure

**1. Opening Frame**
> "[Name], I want to rumble on something with you. I care about [relationship/work/outcome], and there's something I need to be clear about because I think being unclear would be unkind."

**2. The Specific Issue**
> "[Specific, observable behavior/situation]"

**3. The Impact**
> "When this happens, [how it affects you/team/work]."

**4. Owning My Part**
> "I want to own that [your contribution]. That's on me."

**5. Staying Curious - Questions to Ask**
- "[Rumble question 1]"
- "[Rumble question 2]"
- "[Rumble question 3]"

**6. Inviting Dialogue**
> "What's your take? What am I missing?"

**7. Action Agreement**
What we'll do differently:
- [Action 1]
- [Action 2]
- Check-in: [When]

---

### Post-Rumble Reflection Prompts
After the conversation, ask yourself:
- Did I stay curious?
- What did I learn about my SFD?
- What's my next action?
```

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| They get defensive | "I hear that this is hard. I want to understand your perspective. Say more about what's going on for you." |
| You get triggered | "I'm noticing I'm getting activated. Can we take a break and come back to this in [timeframe]?" |
| They deny the issue | "Help me understand how you see it. I might be missing something, but here's the impact I'm experiencing..." |
| Conversation goes sideways | "I want to make sure we're solving the right problem. Can we step back? What's the core issue from your perspective?" |
| They attack your character | "I'm going to stay focused on the specific issue. This isn't about who we are as people - it's about what's happening and how we move forward." |
| No resolution reached | "We may need to sit with this. Let's take a break and come back when we've both had time to reflect." |

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "My tech lead keeps making architecture decisions without consulting the team. I'm frustrated because we discussed collaborative decision-making, but it's not happening. Our relationship is good otherwise, but this is creating resentment."

**Output:**

## Rumble Preparation: Architecture Decision-Making

### Pre-Rumble Self-Examination

**My SFD (The story I'm making up):**
They don't value the team's input. They think they know best and the rest of us are just implementers. Maybe they don't respect my technical judgment.

**Reality check:** Is this story definitely true, or is it my fear talking?
This is probably my fear talking. They've valued my input in other contexts. There might be pressure I don't see, or they might not realize the impact.

**My Part:**
I haven't spoken up directly when decisions were made. I complained to teammates instead of addressing it. I might not have been clear about how much I want to be involved.

**My Intention Check:**
Am I entering this to understand, or to be right?
Honestly, part of me wants to be right. But I genuinely want to understand what's happening and find a way forward that works.

### The Rumble Structure

**1. Opening Frame**
> "Hey, I want to rumble on something with you. I care about our working relationship and the team's health, and there's something I need to be clear about because I think avoiding it would be unkind to both of us."

**2. The Specific Issue**
> "In the last month, there have been three architecture decisions - the database migration approach, the API versioning strategy, and the caching implementation - that were finalized before the team had input. I know we talked about collaborative decision-making, and I'm noticing that's not happening."

**3. The Impact**
> "When decisions are made without the team's input, I feel devalued and disconnected from the work. It also means we're missing perspectives that might catch problems earlier. The caching decision, for example - I had concerns that I never got to share."

**4. Owning My Part**
> "I want to own that I haven't spoken up in the moment. I've been frustrated privately instead of being clear with you. That's on me, and I'm changing that now."

**5. Staying Curious - Questions to Ask**
- "Help me understand what's happening from your side. Is there pressure I'm not seeing?"
- "When you make these decisions, what's driving the timeline?"
- "What would make it easier to include the team earlier?"

**6. Inviting Dialogue**
> "What's your take on this? What am I missing about why things are happening this way?"

**7. Action Agreement**
What we'll do differently:
- For decisions above [threshold], team review before finalizing
- I'll speak up in the moment instead of after
- Check-in: In two weeks to see if it's working

---

### Post-Rumble Reflection Prompts
After the conversation, ask yourself:
- Did I stay curious?
- What did I learn about my SFD?
- What's my next action?
